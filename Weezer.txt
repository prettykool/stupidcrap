>Be me
>Bullied in high school
>Jocks are shitting on me because I listen to weezer
>One day
>After gym practice
>Break into the schools main office while everyone else is on break
>Hook up shitty 2008 laptop to P.A.
>In the locker room, the Jocks hear the speakers turn on
>suddenly, the sounds of River Cumomo, his gay friends, and their pulsating rythms blast from the P.A.
>"WHAT'S WITH THESE HOMIES DISSING MY GIRL"
>The jocks start screaming in pain as their muscles shrink from their bodies
>"WHY DO THEY GOTTA FRONT?"
>Their arms deflate like balloons into twigs, their front teeth stretch out of their mouths.
>"WHAT DID WE EVER DO TO THESE GUYS"
>Their hair is covered in a sheen of grease, and form into a blunt bowl cut
>"THAT MADE THEM SO VI-O-LAHAUNT?"
>Their $2000 supreme shirts their parents bought them metaphorises into pantone polos, their sweatpants turn to kahki slacks
>"HOO-HOO"
>Their faces gain deep acne scars; Ratty, half-grown mustaches sprout on their faces
>"AND YOU KNOW I'M YOURS"
>Their massive members shrink to the size of mere peanuts; their virginities being restored
>"HOO-HOO"
>Their backs break, forming an unnatural curve in their posture
>"AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE MINE"
>From their orfaces, a putrid, onion-like smell begins to emit
>"HOO-HOO"
>Suddenly, they all turn their heads up
>"THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU!"
>A twisted, vile smile curls onto their heads
>"OOH-WEE-OOH I LOOK JUST LIKE BUDDY HOLLY!"
>They all sing together, in atonal unison, running out of the locker rooms into the main halls
>"OH-OH, AND YOU'RE MARY TYLER MOORE!"
>They begin charging at the few unfortuate female students, tearing their shirts off.
>"I DON'T CARE WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US ANYWAYS!"
>They burst into the main office. For a mere second, I am able to look at what I have created. Their ugly, spectacled eyes turn towards me
>"I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT!"
>I laugh. I laugh as they tear my body open, tearing out my internal organs, fighting over them.
>In my final moments, I hear the key-tar riff of my favorite song, the song that caused all this.
>I try to make through to hear the first part of the second verse. I can't
>I've lost too much blood
>And the crowd that's now gathering around my dying body is getting more desperate to find something from me that they can consume
>I breath my last breath, right as one of them bites down on my jugular.
>Fin.
